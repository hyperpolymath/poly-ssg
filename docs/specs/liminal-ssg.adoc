|Paradigm |Time-reversible, zero-entropy
|===

== Rationale

=== Why ARCHIVE

The reversible computing angle is intellectually fascinating but practically useless for SSG:

1. **No Janus implementation**: The academic Janus papers exist, but there's no production-ready interpreter or compiler available.

2. **Reversibility solves no SSG problem**: You don't need to "un-build" a site. Version control already provides this via `git checkout`.

3. **Overlaps with undo-ssg**: Both claim reversible computing benefits. Having two reversible-language SSGs doubles effort for the same non-problem.

4. **Thermodynamic claims are irrelevant**: The Landauer limit applies at the transistor level. Your SSG's energy footprint is dominated by disk I/O, not logical operations.

=== The "January" Name Confusion

The README uses "january-ssg" internally but the repo is "liminal-ssg". This naming inconsistency suggests incomplete planning.

== Consolidation with undo-ssg

If reversible computing research is genuinely interesting, consolidate:

- **Keep ONE** reversible SSG project
- **Archive the other**
- Recommend keeping `undo-ssg` since Arrow has slightly more tooling than Janus

== Alternative Disposition

=== Option 1: Archive (Recommended)

Reversible computing doesn't solve any real SSG problem.

=== Option 2: Merge into undo-ssg

Add Janus as an alternative backend if both languages need exploration.

=== Option 3: Research Project

Keep as academic exploration of reversible computing, not production SSG:
- Conference paper material
- Computer science education
- Clearly labeled as "research, not production"

== Recommendation

Archive. If reversible computing is desired, focus on undo-ssg alone.

== Effort Saved

Archiving prevents 60+ hours of bootstrapping a second reversible language for the same unsolved problem.
