== Rationale

=== Why ARCHIVE

The concept of "consensus-driven SSG" is intellectually interesting but practically absurd:

1. **Solves a non-problem**: Static sites don't need distributed consensus. There's one source of truth (your content files), one build process, one output.

2. **Massive overhead**: Running a Raft cluster to build a blog is like using a freight train to deliver a letter.

3. **Complexity without benefit**: The failure modes of distributed systems (split-brain, leader election delays, network partitions) add risk without solving any actual SSG problem.

4. **No target audience**: Who would deploy a 3+ node cluster just to generate HTML files?

=== Potential Misunderstanding

If the intent was **distributed build caching** (like Bazel remote cache) or **edge deployment coordination**, that's different and potentially valuable. But the README describes actual Raft consensus for build commits, which is overkill.

== Alternative Disposition

=== Option 1: Archive entirely

Recommended. The concept doesn't serve a real use case.

=== Option 2: Pivot to INTEGRATION

If there's genuine interest in distributed builds, pivot to:

- **poly-ssg-cache**: Distributed content-addressable build cache
- **poly-ssg-deploy**: Multi-region deployment coordination

These would be *integrations* with actual SSG engines, not standalone generators.

=== Option 3: Conceptual Theme

Repurpose as a *THEME* for another engine with "consensus protocol" visual aesthetics (network diagrams, node status displays, leader indicators).

== Recommendation

Archive. If distributed systems integration is desired, create a focused `poly-ssg-cache` or `poly-deploy-mcp` project instead.

== Effort Saved

Archiving prevents 80+ hours of implementing Raft just to generate static HTML.
