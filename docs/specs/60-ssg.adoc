== Rationale

=== Why ARCHIVE

ALGOL 60 is historically significant as the ancestor of structured programming, but it presents insurmountable practical challenges:

1. **No modern toolchain**: There is no actively maintained ALGOL 60 interpreter or compiler. The claim of using asdf is aspirational at best.

2. **Zero ecosystem**: No package management, no libraries for HTTP, HTML generation, file watching, or any modern SSG requirements.

3. **Academic curiosity only**: While the "block-structured purity" angle is philosophically interesting, it provides no practical value over any modern language.

4. **Overlapping niche**: If the goal is historical/pedagogical, canon-ssg (Standard ML) provides similar "formal definition" appeal with actual tooling.

=== What Could Be Salvaged

The *name* "60" could be repurposed for something meaningful:
- A "60-second site" generator (ultra-fast builds)
- A minimalist "60 lines of code" SSG reference implementation
- A "1960s aesthetic" theme for another engine

== Recommendation

Archive this repository. If the historical programming angle is desired, redirect effort to canon-ssg (Standard ML) which has similar formal-definition purity with actual working compilers (MLton, SML/NJ).

== Alternative Disposition

If preservation is preferred over archival:
- Convert to a *THEME* for casket-ssg (Haskell) with 1960s computer-era aesthetic
- Vintage monospace fonts, green-on-black terminal styling, paper-tape motifs

== Effort Saved

Archiving prevents 40+ hours of attempting to bootstrap a dead language ecosystem.
