== Summary

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Name |tripos-ssg
|Verdict |*ARCHIVE* or *THEME*
|Language |Unspecified
|Paradigm |"Structured"
|===

== Rationale

=== Current State

README is minimal:
- "A structured static site generator"
- "Under development"
- No language, architecture, or technical details

This is an empty placeholder with a vague description.

=== Name Analysis

"Tripos" has several meanings:
1. Cambridge University examination system
2. Three-legged stand/stool
3. Historical: verse composition contests

The name suggests academic/examination themes or triple-structured architecture.

=== Why ARCHIVE or THEME

1. **"Structured" describes every SSG**: All SSGs transform structured content into structured output.

2. **No unique angle**: Without a defined language or paradigm, there's nothing to implement.

3. **Cambridge theme potential**: Could become an academic/examination themed presentation.

== Decision Required

=== Option A: Define a Language

If there's a specific language in mind:
- BCPL (Cambridge connection, historical)
- ML (Edinburgh/Cambridge roots)
- Something three-part structured (matching "tripos")

Then re-evaluate as ENGINE.

=== Option B: THEME

Repurpose as academic/examination theme:
- Tripos examination styling
- Cambridge academic aesthetics
- Educational content organization
- Grading/scoring visualizations

Theme for casket-ssg (Haskell has Cambridge roots via ML lineage).

=== Option C: Archive (Recommended)

No defined purpose, no defined language. Archive.

== Recommendation

Archive unless there's specific intent for an academic-themed project.

== If Proceeding as THEME

=== Design Elements
- Academic typography (Baskerville, Garamond)
- Examination paper layouts
- Structured question/answer formats
- Grade boundaries and scoring displays
- Cambridge blue accents

=== Target Engine
casket-ssg - functional programming has academic heritage
