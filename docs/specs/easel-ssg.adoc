== Summary

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Name |easel-ssg
|Verdict |*ARCHIVE*
|Language |Piet (esoteric, bitmap-based)
|Paradigm |Visual/chromatic programming
|===

== Rationale

=== Why ARCHIVE

Piet is fascinating but impractical for real software:

1. **Unusable development experience**: You can't grep, diff, or version control a bitmap meaningfully. Code review is impossible.

2. **Debugging nightmare**: There's no step-through debugger for colored pixels. You'd be manually tracing color transitions.

3. **No real tooling**: While npiet exists, it's a toy interpreter. There's no ecosystem for libraries, package management, or IDE support.

4. **Performance concerns**: Piet interpretation is inherently slow due to image parsing overhead.

5. **Security theater**: "Steganographic metadata" sounds cool but provides no real security. Security through obscurity isn't security.

=== What's Actually Interesting

The *art project* aspect is genuinely creative:
- Generate Piet programs that are also aesthetically pleasing
- Use site generation as art installation
- Explore non-textual computing paradigms

But this belongs in an art gallery, not a production toolchain.

== Alternative Disposition

=== Option 1: Archive (Recommended)

This is conceptual art, not practical software.

=== Option 2: Art Project THEME

Repurpose as a *THEME* that generates Piet-inspired visuals:
- Color-block layouts
- Chromatic navigation
- Pixel art aesthetic
- "Source code as art" galleries

This would be a theme for hackenbush-ssg or eclipse-ssg.

=== Option 3: Code Golf Curiosity

Keep as a challenge project:
- "Build hello world in Piet SSG"
- Esoteric language benchmark suite
- Conference talk/demo material

Not worth production investment.

== Recommendation

Archive. Redirect creative energy to visual themes for working engines.

== Effort Saved

Archiving prevents 100+ hours of fighting bitmap manipulation for text transformation.
