== Rationale

=== Why ARCHIVE

While creatively written, this project has fundamental problems:

1. **No QPL toolchain exists**: The Selinger paper defines QPL mathematically, but there's no compiler or interpreter. You'd have to write one first.

2. **Quantum computing doesn't help SSGs**: Markdown parsing isn't a quantum speedup candidate. There's no exponential advantage to be gained.

3. **QRAM doesn't exist**: The architecture assumes a "QRAM machine model" which is theoretical. There's no hardware or simulator to run this on.

4. **Misleading claims**: "Measurement-driven rendering" and "entangled templates" sound cool but are physically meaningless for text transformation.

=== The Core Problem

SSG operations are classical:
- Read file -> O(n)
- Parse markdown -> O(n)
- Apply template -> O(n)
- Write output -> O(n)

Quantum computing provides speedups for:
- Unstructured search (Grover's)
- Factoring (Shor's)
- Optimization (QAOA)

There's no intersection.

== Alternative Disposition

=== Option 1: Archive (Recommended)

This is creative fiction, not a viable project.

=== Option 2: Educational THEME

Repurpose as a *THEME* for another engine with quantum computing aesthetics:
- Superposition state diagrams
- Bloch sphere visualizations
- Quantum circuit notation
- "Entanglement" relationship graphs

This would be a casket-ssg or eclipse-ssg theme for quantum computing documentation sites.

== Recommendation

Archive. The README is well-written but describes impossible technology.

== Effort Saved

Archiving prevents attempting to implement a non-existent programming language on non-existent hardware.
