= Poly SSG Comparison Site
:toc: auto

image:https://img.shields.io/badge/RSR-compliant-blue[RSR Compliant]
image:https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-green[Status: Active]

Interactive comparison of SSG engines (Casket, Hackenbush, Bunsenite, Cobalt) built with ReScript, Deno, and formally verified components from proven.

== Architecture

* *ReScript* - Type-safe frontend compilation
* *Deno* - Modern runtime (no Node.js per RSR)
* *proven* - Formally verified string operations
* *TEA* - The Elm Architecture for state management

=== Formally Verified Components

This site uses *ProvenSafeString* from the proven library for safe config generation, ensuring:

* No string overflow or underflow
* Memory-safe concatenation
* Proven correctness of output format

== Development

=== Build

[source,bash]
----
# Build ReScript to JavaScript
deno task build

# Watch mode
deno task watch

# Clean artifacts
deno task clean
----

=== Local Server

[source,bash]
----
deno run -A jsr:@std/http/file-server .
# or
python3 -m http.server 8000
----

== Features

* *Interactive Engine Selection* - Choose between SSG engines
* *Live Config Generation* - See engine-specific configuration
* *Feature Comparison* - Understand engine capabilities
* *Safe String Operations* - Formally verified config building

== Project Status (2026-01-30)

* ✅ ReScript compilation with Deno
* ✅ proven integration for safe strings
* ✅ PolySsgApp.res with TEA architecture
* ✅ Security hardening (.well-known/, headers, DNS)
* ⏳ Full UI implementation (basic render)
* ⏳ Visual comparison table
* ⏳ Interactive feature filtering
