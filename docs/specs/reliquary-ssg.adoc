== Summary

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Name |reliquary-ssg
|Verdict |*THEME* or *ARCHIVE*
|Language |Unspecified
|Paradigm |Digital preservation
|===

== Rationale

=== Current State

The README is minimal:
- "Preserving digital artifacts"
- "Under development"
- No language, architecture, or technical details

This is essentially an empty placeholder.

=== Why THEME or ARCHIVE

Without a defined language or paradigm:

1. **No unique technical angle**: "Digital preservation" is a use case, not a programming paradigm.

2. **Could be any engine**: Preservation features (archival formats, metadata, checksums) could be added to any SSG.

3. **Better as integration**: If preservation matters, create `poly-ssg-archive` plugin that works with all engines.

== Decision Required

=== Option A: Define as THEME

Repurpose "reliquary" as an aesthetic/functional theme:
- Museum/archive visual design
- Preservation-focused layouts
- Metadata-rich display templates
- Integration with archive.org, LOCKSS, etc.

Theme for casket-ssg or hackenbush-ssg.

=== Option B: Define as INTEGRATION

Create `poly-ssg-preserve` plugin:
- WARC file generation
- Content checksum manifests
- Archive.org submission automation
- LOCKSS/CLOCKSS integration

=== Option C: Archive

If preservation isn't a priority, archive the empty repo.

== Recommendation

**THEME** - The name "reliquary" (container for sacred relics) evokes museum/archival aesthetics. Make it a preservation-themed presentation layer for another engine.

== If Proceeding as THEME

=== Design Elements
- Sepia/parchment color schemes
- Artifact cards with metadata
- Timeline visualizations
- Provenance tracking displays
- "Preserved on [date]" stamps

=== Target Engine
casket-ssg (Haskell) - good fit for complex metadata handling
