== Summary

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Name |region-ssg
|Verdict |*ARCHIVE*
|Language |ZPL (Z-level Programming Language)
|Paradigm |Parallel array regions
|===

== Rationale

=== Why ARCHIVE

ZPL is an interesting historical language but impractical:

1. **Dead project**: ZPL development ceased around 2006. The University of Washington ZPL project is archived.

2. **No maintained compiler**: The ZPL compiler (zc) hasn't been updated in nearly 20 years. It likely won't build on modern systems.

3. **Solved problem space**: Modern array parallelism is better served by:
   - Julia (general array computing)
   - Futhark (GPU array computing)
   - Chapel (parallel programming)

4. **Overlapping with iota-ssg/jura-ssg**: If array-oriented parallelism is desired, APL or J are active languages with maintained toolchains.

5. **No practical benefit**: Static site generation doesn't need distributed-memory parallelism. You're not processing petabytes.

== Alternative Disposition

=== Option 1: Archive (Recommended)

ZPL is a historical artifact. Archive.

=== Option 2: Pivot to Chapel

If parallel array programming is genuinely desired, consider:

- **Chapel**: Active development at HPE, modern syntax, real parallelism
- **Futhark**: Functional array language, compiles to GPU code

A "chapel-ssg" would have the same array/parallel appeal with actual tooling.

=== Option 3: THEME

Repurpose "region" as a theme concept:
- Geographic/regional content organization
- Multi-region deployment visualization
- Map-based navigation

This would be a theme for another engine.

== Recommendation

Archive. If parallel array computing appeals, redirect to iota-ssg (APL) or jura-ssg (J), or consider a new Chapel-based project.

== Effort Saved

Archiving prevents 80+ hours of archaeology trying to build a 20-year-old compiler.
