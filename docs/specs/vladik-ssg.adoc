== Summary

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Name |vladik-ssg
|Verdict |*INTEGRATION*
|Language |Anvomidav (choreographic DSL)
|Paradigm |Sequence-driven, transition-based
|Integrates With |hyperpolymath/anvomidav
|===

== Rationale

=== Why INTEGRATION (not ENGINE)

vladik-ssg is an Anvomidav showcase, not a standalone SSG:

1. **Dependent on Anvomidav**: This exists to demonstrate Anvomidav capabilities.

2. **Niche domain mapping**: Figure skating choreography -> site generation is creative but forced.

3. **No practical advantage**: "Sequences" are just build order. "Transitions" are just links. The mapping adds conceptual overhead without benefit.

4. **Better as demonstration**: Shows what Anvomidav can do for a non-obvious domain.

=== What's Interesting

The choreographic metaphor is creative:

- **Elements as content types** (jumps = major pages, spins = persistent sections)
- **Transitions as navigation** (flow between pages)
- **Program as site** (rendered experience)

But this is artistic metaphor, not technical advantage.

== Recommended Position

vladik-ssg should be:
- In the Anvomidav ecosystem as a showcase
- Clearly labeled as "artistic exploration"
- Not recommended for actual site building

== Alternative: THEME

Repurpose the figure skating metaphor as visual design:

- **Ice rink aesthetics** (white, blue, crystalline)
- **Program flow visualizations** (sequence diagrams)
- **Scoring-style content evaluation** (technical/artistic scores)
- **Performance art galleries**

This would be a *THEME* for casket-ssg or eclipse-ssg.

== If Proceeding as INTEGRATION

=== Scope
- Demonstration of Anvomidav for unusual domains
- Art project / creative coding
- Conference talk material

=== Non-Scope
- Production SSG
- General-purpose site generation
- Performance-critical builds

== Implementation Roadmap

=== Phase 1: Anvomidav Integration
- [ ] Depend on working Anvomidav compiler
- [ ] Map choreographic concepts to SSG
- [ ] Document the metaphor clearly

=== Phase 2: Showcase Sites
- [ ] Figure skating portfolio site
- [ ] Dance company documentation
- [ ] Performance art galleries

=== Phase 3: Art Documentation
- [ ] Write about the conceptual mapping
- [ ] Create visual documentation
- [ ] Prepare conference presentation

== Estimated Effort

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Phase |Time

|Anvomidav integration
|2 weeks (assumes working Anvomidav)

|Showcase sites
|2 weeks

|Documentation
|1 week

|**Total**
|**5 weeks**
|===

== Dependency

vladik-ssg cannot proceed until Anvomidav itself is sufficiently developed. Check Anvomidav status first.
