|Name |undo-ssg
|Verdict |*ARCHIVE*
|Language |Arrow (reversible computing)
|Paradigm |Zero-entropy, isomorphic transformation
|===

== Rationale

=== Why ARCHIVE

Despite interesting concepts, reversible computing doesn't serve SSG needs:

1. **Arrow tooling is limited**: The Arrow language has academic implementations but no production-grade toolchain.

2. **Reversibility solves no real problem**:
   - "Un-building" a site? Use `git checkout`
   - Verifying source integrity? Use checksums
   - Deterministic builds? Use any pure functional language

3. **Thermodynamic claims are irrelevant**: The energy savings of reversible computing apply at transistor scale. Your SSG's power consumption is dominated by:
   - Disk I/O
   - Network activity
   - Display rendering
   - NOT logical operations

4. **Duplicates liminal-ssg**: Both claim reversible computing benefits. Having two reversible SSGs doubles maintenance for zero practical gain.

=== The Core Misconception

Reversible computing is about:
- Theoretical computation models
- Quantum computing foundations
- Thermodynamic limits of computation

It's NOT about:
- Version control (solved by git)
- Build reproducibility (solved by determinism)
- Deployment rollback (solved by artifact storage)

== Consolidation with liminal-ssg

Both undo-ssg and liminal-ssg target reversible computing. Recommendation:

**Archive BOTH** - Neither solves a real SSG problem.

If one must survive for research purposes:
- Choose based on tooling availability
- Arrow may have slight edge over Janus
- But neither is production-ready

== Alternative Disposition

=== Option 1: Archive (Recommended)

Reversible computing is fascinating but irrelevant to SSG.

=== Option 2: Research Project

Keep as academic exploration, clearly labeled non-production:
- Computer science education
- Conference paper material
- Reversible computing demonstration

=== Option 3: THEME

Repurpose "undo" as undo/history visualization theme:
- Timeline-based content display
- Diff visualizations
- Version history navigation
- "Undo" button aesthetics

== Recommendation

Archive both undo-ssg and liminal-ssg. Reversible computing doesn't solve SSG problems.

== Effort Saved

Archiving prevents 60+ hours of implementing academic computing theory for text transformation.
